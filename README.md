# New HTML5 API’s (Application Programming Interfaces)
<b>The most interesting new API’s are:</b>
1. HTML Geolocation: HTML Geolocation is used to locate a user’s position. The HTML Geolocation API is used to get the geographical position of a user.
2. HTML Drag and Drop: Drag and drop is a very common feature. It is when you “grab” an object and drag it to a different location.
3. HTML Local Storage: With local storage, web applications can store data locally within the user’s browser.
4. HTML Application Cache: Application caching mechanism lets web-based applications run offline.With application cache, it is easy to make an offline version of a web application, by creating a cache manifest file. Developers can use the Application Cache (AppCache) interface to specify resources that the browser should cache and make available to offline users. Applications that are cached load and work correctly even if users click the refresh button when they are offline.
5. HTML Web Workers: Web Workers provide a simple means for web content to run scripts in background threads.
6. HTML SSE: Server-Sent Events allow a web page to get updates from a server.
