# New HTML5 API’s (Application Programming Interfaces)
<b>The most interesting new API’s are:</b>
1. HTML Geolocation: HTML Geolocation is used to locate a user’s position. The HTML Geolocation API is used to get the geographical position of a user.
2. HTML Drag and Drop: Drag and drop is a very common feature. It is when you “grab” an object and drag it to a different location.
3. HTML Local Storage: With local storage, web applications can store data locally within the user’s browser.
4. HTML Application Cache: Application caching mechanism lets web-based applications run offline.With application cache, it is easy to make an offline version of a web application, by creating a cache manifest file. Developers can use the Application Cache (AppCache) interface to specify resources that the browser should cache and make available to offline users. Applications that are cached load and work correctly even if users click the refresh button when they are offline.
5. HTML Web Workers: Web Workers provide a simple means for web content to run scripts in background threads.
6. HTML SSE: Server-Sent Events allow a web page to get updates from a server.

        With the help of regular expression we can add the particular pattern as an input. Such as the most common pattern that is used is [A-Za-z] {5,11}.

Along with this it states that the minimum length of characters is 5 and the maximum length of characters that is acceptable is           11.
 13. <b>Accessibility</b><br/>

 14. <b>Inline elements</b><br/>
        To keep code up to mark, semantically these inline elements help alot :<br/>
                1. mark – It highlights the content that is marked in some or the other way.
                2. time – This helps in adding current time as well as date to the webpage.

 16. <b>Email attribute</b><br/>
        When in a form we write the type as email, then browser by itself gets the instruction from the code to write an email with the proper as well as valid format of writing         an email. This was not possible in the earlier browsers.
       <b> Example:</b> Email attribute example:<br/>
       <p align="center">
               <img src="https://github.com/ravigithub09/HTML5/blob/master/email%20ex.PNG" width="500" height="400" title="email">
                </p>   
17. <b>Cryptographic nonces</b><br/>
       In this newer version of HTML, we can add cryptographic nonces to all the styles as well as scripts. Here, we usually use nonce attribute inside script and style tag.            This nonce tag basically generates a random number which is for one time use only.<br/>
       So, it is regenerated each time the page refreshes. It is great features as it can be used to increase the security of the content of the page. This helps in stating and        providing the authority to the webpage to specify a particular script or style.
              <b> Example:</b> Cryptographic nonces example:<br/>
              <p align="center">
               <img src="https://github.com/ravigithub09/HTML5/blob/master/cryptographic%20ex.PNG" width="500" height="150" title="Cryptographic nonces">
                </p>   
                
18. <b>Reverse Links</b><br/>
    <b>rev<b> attribute is back in action again with the use of HTML 5.1. It basically allows the web users to again use the link and a or anchor tag elements. It explains the         relationship between the current document as well as the linked document but in the opposite direction.
  
19. <b>Zero width images</b><br/>
       Now the web developers can make the width of the images as zero. This feature is of great hel pwhen there is no need to show them to the users such as while tracking the        image files as otherwise it would take more space. It is advisable to use the zero width images with the alt tag that is empty.
          <b> Example:</b> Zero width images example:<br/>
              <p align="center">
               <img src="https://github.com/ravigithub09/HTML5/blob/master/0-width-img.PNG" width="1100" height="200" title="0-width-image">
